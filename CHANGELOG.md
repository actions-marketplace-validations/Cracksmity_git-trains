# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.1.2 (2026-11-06)

No input, output name, route or published file changes. This release collects the security hardening done after 1.1.1 and tidies the repository.

### Security

- Restrict the local preview server to loopback and public assets, including checks on symlink targets.
- Bound shared-link decompression, custom drawing dimensions and nose operations before rendering. Rejected train JSON stays editable without building a pixel grid.
- Restrict Antigravity design tools to reads of staged inputs, and document the AI providers' access and data handling.
- Pin workflow actions, add Dependabot and a private reporting policy, and check the community index in pull requests so publishing it no longer needs a direct push to main.

### Changed

- The code is organized into domain folders (`activity`, `graphics`, `trains`, `landscape`, `scene`, `cards`, `calendar`, `review`, `github`, `action`, `cli`, `studio`, `sharing`) with `npm run check` gates for architecture (acyclic imports, layer boundaries, 400-line modules), generated assets, links and AI examples. Rendered SVGs are unchanged.
- The READMEs lead with what the Action draws and a shorter setup, and installation examples use a commit that contains the security fixes above.

### Added

- Project logo and favicon.

## 1.1.1 (2026-11-05)

### Fixed

- The studio's skyline canvas no longer shrinks to tiny buildings on a phone or in a narrow column. It zooms (Fit, 2×, 3×, 4×; 2× by default when fitting would draw scene pixels smaller than 1.5 screen pixels) and scrolls sideways: drag the empty sky to pan, and picking a building from the list scrolls to it. A click within about 10 screen pixels of a thin tower grabs it.

## 1.1.0 (2026-11-05)

Nothing from 1.0 breaks: no input or output file changes name. Seasons and unlockable cars are on by default (turn them off with `seasons: false` and `unlocks: false`); everything else is opt-in.

### Added

- **Year in review.** `year-in-review: true` writes `year-in-review.svg` (and `-light` / `-dark` with `theme: both`, like the other outputs): a poster of one calendar year of your activity, drawn as a train journey. Four LED-number panels (contributions, active days, longest streak with its dates, busiest day); a route map with a rail line and 12 month stations, each a tower as tall as that month was busy, the busiest one flying a flag; your train (the model from `train`: catalog, custom JSON or steam locomotive, with the cars that year's total earns and the special car if you earned one) running the line in 1 px steps, stopping longest at the busiest months, passing months with nothing, and parked at December with `prefers-reduced-motion`; then the busiest month and the top languages of that year (the primary languages of the repositories you committed to, by commits). It follows `theme`, `language` (`language: es` speaks Spanish) and `border` and takes the five card colors. New inputs: `year-in-review` (`false` by default) and `review-year` (2008 to the current year). Left empty, the year is the current one so far, except in January, when it is the year that just ended. The special car is earned on that year's longest streak plus your profile's stars and pull requests. If it fails the Action warns and still writes everything else. `fetchYear` reads a calendar year (`contributionsCollection(from, to)`, with the same retries), the mini trains have the three special cars, and `npm run docs` draws `docs/example-year-in-review.svg` (and `-es`).
- **AI leaderboard.** A [page](https://cracksmity.github.io/git-trains/leaderboard/) on the site that shows which AI did which task in the conductor: one row per model with its tasks, first-try pass rate, median time, tokens, the routes it served and where it fell back to the next model, then a log of every task run. It reads `docs/leaderboard.json`, which `npm run leaderboard` builds by merging the conductor's `.conductor/runs.jsonl` logs (every git worktree of the checkout, plus `--from <file>` for other machines). Only the date, task id, route, backend, model, effort, attempt, result with the name of the check that failed, seconds and tokens are kept, never prompts, file paths or the user name, and a run already in the file is not added again. A run where the agent crashed before doing anything (a usage limit, say) is listed but does not count against the model. The page links to the Medellín benchmark, and the home page, both READMEs and the conductor README link to the page.
- **Repo mode.** `repo: owner/name` makes the train describe a repository instead of a user, so any project can put a living train in its README (`repo: ${{ github.repository }}` for the workflow's own). The cars, the streak and the speed come from the repository's commits on the default branch in the last year (`/stats/commit_activity`; GitHub answers 202 while it computes them, so the Action asks again a few times and, if the numbers never come, counts the commits one by one and logs a notice), the stripe from its `/languages`, the station and LED signs show the repository name, and the procedural city is seeded with `owner/name`. `calendar: true` draws the commit calendar; `cards: stats` shows stars, forks, commits, open issues and contributors with the same rank ring; `cards: departures` becomes a board of the latest releases (and tags without a release), with `RELEASE`, `PRERELEASE` or `TAG` as the platform; the unlockable cars read the repository's own streak, stars and pull requests. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is enough for public repositories and the workflow's own. Files are named `train-repo*.svg` and `card-repo-*.svg`, so one workflow can draw a profile and a repository into the same folder. Without `repo` nothing changes: every SVG is byte-for-byte what it was. [This repository's own train](README.md#in-a-repository-readme) is drawn that way by the Live train workflow, and [examples/workflow-repo.yml](examples/workflow-repo.yml) is a workflow to copy.
- **Seasons and holidays.** The scene now changes with the date the Action runs (UTC), so a profile feels alive all year: light snow with snow on the roofs and the ground in winter, drifting pink petals in spring, orange leaves in autumn, nothing in summer. A holiday wins over the season: Día de Muertos (Oct 31 – Nov 2, marigold papel picado along the line), Christmas (Dec 15 – Jan 6, blinking lights on the wire), Hacktoberfest (October, a pumpkin by the signal) and New Year (Dec 31 – Jan 1, fireworks behind the city). It is a few pixels on their own layers, behind the train, and stops with `prefers-reduced-motion`. New inputs: `seasons` (`true` by default; `false` keeps the scene plain) and `hemisphere` (`north` or `south`, which flips the seasons; holidays keep their dates). A day with no decoration draws exactly the same SVG as before. The playground has a date picker to preview any day, and `buildSpec` and `renderScene` accept a `date`.
- **Departures board card.** `cards: departures` writes `card-departures.svg`: a split-flap station board (TIME, DESTINATION, PLATFORM, STATUS) with your six most recently pushed public repositories. The status is `BOARDING` (pushed today), `ON TIME` (last 7 days), `DELAYED` (last 30) or `DEPARTED`; the characters flip into place with CSS only and it respects reduced motion. It reads `SALIDAS`, `ANDÉN`... with `language: es` and takes the same colors and border as the other cards. `cards` now accepts a list (`stats, departures`); `both` still means stats and languages. The profile repository is left out of the board.
- **Unlockable cars.** A special car joins the train, right behind the cab, when you earn it: a **dining car** (round windows, a lamp) for a 100-day streak, an **observation car** (glass roof) for 100+ stars, a **mail car** (no windows, a stripe) for 500+ pull requests. Only the rarest one is shown and the image title says which. It needs your profile numbers, so there is one extra API request per run (skipped with a notice if it fails); `unlocks: false` turns it off. With nothing earned the SVGs are exactly the same as before.
- A skyline can bring its region's countryside. The optional `region` block of a skyline JSON draws its own houses, trees, plants and landmark in the strips between tracks (and its plants on the slope in front of the city), a terrain (`hills`, `mountains`, `plains` or `sea`) behind them, and up to four accent colors with a light and a dark value, so they follow the theme. Osaka shows minka farmhouses, cherry trees and a torii; New York a Hudson Valley stone farmhouse and a Dutch barn. Mexico City, Medellín and the two new examples, Guadalajara and Malmö, carry theirs too. Without a `region` the countryside is exactly what it was. [docs/ai/region.md](docs/ai/region.md) tells an AI how to research a region and write the block; `node scripts/region-sheet.js <skyline>` draws its pieces zoomed in.
- `git-trains design`: one command has the AI CLI you already use (Codex, Antigravity or Claude Code) design a train or a skyline from a description and photos: `npx github:Cracksmity/git-trains design train "Osaka Metro 400 series" --photo train.jpg`. The agent runs headless and read-only in an empty temporary folder and only its answer is read; the JSON goes through the same validator as the Action and, if it fails, the problem list goes back for another try (`--tries`, 3 by default). On success it writes `.github/train.json` or `.github/skyline.json`, draws a preview in the terminal and prints a studio link to tweak it. Adds `bin/git-trains.js` (the `bin` of the package); still no dependencies.
- The [studio](https://cracksmity.github.io/git-trains/studio/): design a train by hand, with every field as a form, the nose or locomotive drawn pixel by pixel (over a photo if you like), a live preview with the calendar mini, and share links that carry the whole train in the URL (`studio/#train=...`).
- `calendar: true` writes an animated contribution calendar with a mini version of your train, including custom and steam models. It follows the scene's themes and reduced-motion setting.
- The community depot: anyone can add their city's train or skyline to `community/` with a pull request. A check validates it, draws light and dark previews and comments with them, and the [gallery](https://cracksmity.github.io/git-trains/gallery/) shows every entry live, with a link to open it in the studio. `npm run community` checks the depot and rebuilds `community/index.json`.

## 1.0.0 (2026-11-04)

The project is **git-trains** everywhere now, and it speaks English first. Everything from 0.x keeps working, with deprecation warnings, except the output file names.

### Breaking

- Output files are renamed. Update the paths in your README:

  | 0.x | 1.0 |
  | --- | --- |
  | `tren-light.svg`, `tren-dark.svg`, `tren.svg` | `train-light.svg`, `train-dark.svg`, `train.svg` |
  | `tarjeta-stats.svg` | `card-stats.svg` |
  | `tarjeta-lenguajes.svg` | `card-languages.svg` |

- `language` (formerly `idioma`) defaults to `en`: the sign reads `STREAK`. Set `language: es` to keep `RACHA` and Spanish cards.
- The Action's outputs are `files`, `cars`, `streak`, `state` and `model` (formerly `archivos`, `vagones`, `racha`, `estado`, `modelo`).
- `npm run muestra` is now `npm run sample` and writes to `./sample`.

### Renamed, old names still accepted

- Inputs: `usuario` → `user`, `tren` → `train`, `fondo` → `skyline`, `modo` → `mode`, `tema` → `theme`, `idioma` → `language`, `etiqueta` → `label`, `escala` → `scale`, `salida` → `output-dir`, `tarjetas` → `cards`, `rango` → `rank`, `borde` → `border`, `lenguajes-max` → `max-languages`, `color-fondo` → `color-background`, `color-titulo` → `color-title`, `color-icono` → `color-icon`, `color-texto` → `color-text`, `color-anillo` → `color-ring`. A Spanish input that is set wins over its English twin and logs a warning.
- Values: `rank: letra` → `letter`, `cards: langs` → `languages`.
- Models: `tranvia` → `tram`, `metro-naranja` → `metro-orange`, `metro-gris` → `metro-gray`, `metro-amarillo` → `metro-yellow`, `metro-blanco` (and `suburbano`) → `metro-white`, `bala` → `bullet`. Also inside custom trains (`"nose": "bala"`).
- Skylines: `ciudad` → `city`, `nueva-york` → `new-york`.
- AI guides: `docs/ia/tren.md` → `docs/ai/train.md`, `docs/ia/fondo.md` → `docs/ai/skyline.md`. Examples moved to `examples/trains/` and `examples/skylines/`. The benchmark moved to `benchmarks/medellin/` (the old URL redirects).

### Added

- **A city of your own.** The procedural city (and its bushes, villages and ballast) is seeded with your username: every user gets a different skyline, the same one every day.
- `exclude-languages`: leave languages such as `HTML` or `Jupyter Notebook` out of the stripes and the cards.
- Retries with backoff when GitHub's API answers 5xx or the network blips.
- The image title follows `language` ("octocat's train: 4 cars, 12-day streak").
- CI on every push and pull request: tests, up-to-date example SVGs, links, the AI guides' examples, and the Action run end to end.
- A live train in the README, redrawn daily by this repository's own workflow onto the `output` branch.
- The playground shows the per-user city (type any username) and the sign language.
- `tools/conductor`: delegates tasks to Codex or Antigravity (Gemini), checks them with gates and escalates along a model ladder.
- Issue templates, a pull request template and a contributing guide.

## 0.x

Built in Spanish as **git-trenes**: the train, the six catalog models, multi-track mode, profile cards, custom trains and skylines designed by AI, steam locomotives, and the Medellín benchmark.
